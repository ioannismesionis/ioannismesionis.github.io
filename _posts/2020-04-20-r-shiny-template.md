Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

Shiny combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web.

The purpose of this post is to present a minimalistic R shiny app I developed some time ago. The full code is present on my GitHub repository. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ioannismesionis/r-shiny-template "GitHub Repository").

For sample images, please see below.
