INTRODUCTION

**Customer segmentation** is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.

Companies employing customer segmentation operate under the fact that every customer is different and that their marketing efforts would be better served if they target specific, smaller groups with messages that those consumers would find relevant and lead them to buy something. Companies also hope to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs with the idea of discovering what each segment finds most valuable to more accurately tailor marketing materials toward that segment.

Customer segmentation relies on identifying key differentiators that divide customers into groups that can be targeted. Information such as a customers' demographics (age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, education level), geography (where they live and work), psychographic (social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics) and behavioral (spending, consumption, usage and desired benefits) tendencies are taken into account when determining customer segmentation practices.

-   Better ROI for marketing
    -   Affirmations that right marketing messages are sent to the right people based on their life cycle stage.
-   Reveal new opportunities
    -   Customer segmentation may reveal new trends about products and it may even give the first mover’s advantage in a product segment.
    
Approach  Machine Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a class of Machine Learning techniques to find the patterns in data. The data given to unsupervised algorithm are not labelled, which means only the input variables(X) are given with no corresponding output variables. In unsupervised learning, the algorithms are left to themselves to discover interesting structures in the data.

There are some analytics techniques that can help you with segmenting your customers. These are useful especially when you have a large number of customers and it’s hard to discover patterns in your customer data just by looking at transactions. The two most common ones are

``` r
## Importing packages
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_bw())
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
