The purpose of LeetCode is to provide with hands-on training on real coding interview questions. The Online Judge gives immediate feedback on the correctness and efficiency of your algorithm which facilitates a great learning experience.

====================

What a better way to spend your "time-off" by puting your python skills to the test? During the covid-19 pandemic, I decided to participate to the LeetCode 30-day challenge as a learning opportunity to further improve my coding and problem-solving skills.

You can find the source code in my [GitHub LeetCode Repository](https://github.com/ioannismesionis/LeetCode)

LeetCode Announcement
====================

With many of us around the world being encouraged to stay indoors and work from home, this is the perfect opportunity for you to focus on studying up for future code interviews. In order to help you stay focused, LeetCode is running the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge for the month of April. A problem will appear [here](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/) at midnight PDT each day, and you'll have 24 hours to solve it and submit it here on the Explore Card.

Solving a problem within 24 hours of it appearing here will reward you with LeetCoins. Completing all 30 on the day they appear will reward you with even more LeetCoins, and an entry into a prize draw where 3 lucky winners will win cool prizes! More details on the prizes can be found in the announcement.

If you've previously solved the problem before, you must resubmit it here in this Explore Card for it to be counted.

If you miss a problem, it'll still be here for you, however, you won't get any LeetCoins for it, and you'll no longer be eligible for the prize draw.

Check out the announcement for more information. Also, don't forget to add the event to your calendar!

Good luck, and happy coding! We wish you all the best with your interview preparation.
